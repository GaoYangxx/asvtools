\title{ASV Counts Table}
\format{
A data frame with 40 rows (representing unique ASVs) and
24 columns (representing individual samples). The values within
the data frame are integer read counts. The row names are ASV identifiers.
\describe{
\item{JRG_1, JRG_2, JRG_3, JRG_4, JRG_5, JRG_6}{Integer read counts for individual samples from the JRG group.}
\item{JJG_1, JJG_2, JJG_3, JJG_4, JJG_5, JJG_6}{Integer read counts for individual samples from the JJG group.}
\item{TZG_1, TZG_2, TZG_3, TZG_4, TZG_5, TZG_6}{Integer read counts for individual samples from the TZG group.}
\item{PAG_1, PAG_2, PAG_3, PAG_4, PAG_5, PAG_6}{Integer read counts for individual samples from the PAG group.}
}

\source{
This dataset was derived from raw sequencing data, undergoing initial
quality filtering, denoising, and chimera removal steps using DADA2,
followed by sample- and group-based filtering criteria.
}
\usage{
ASVs
}
\description{
A comprehensive dataset containing Amplicon Sequence Variant (ASV) read counts
across various samples. This data is typically generated from 16S rRNA gene sequencing
and has been pre-processed to include only filtered and deduplicated ASVs.
}
\details{
The \code{ASVs} dataset is a core component for downstream microbial community
analyses, including diversity calculations, differential abundance testing,
and compositional analyses. It includes samples from JRG, JJG, TZG, and PAG groups.
